### A concordance script

This is a toy problem I completed for evalutation purposes.

Given an arbitrary text document written in English, write a program that will generate a concordance, i.e. an alphabetical list of all word occurrences, labeled with word frequencies. Bonus: label each word with the sentence numbers in which each occurrence appeared.

# Sample output
```
a {3:1,2,2}
all {1:2}
alphabetical {1:2}
an {2:2,2}
appeared {1:3}
arbitrary {1:2}
bonus {1:3}

```
